I have fixed the dark mode text visibility issues for the placeholder text in the `Study` page.

Here is a summary of the changes:

<br>

- Added dark mode styles to `Study.css` for `.study-textarea::placeholder` and `.study-input::placeholder` to ensure the placeholder text is visible against dark backgrounds.

I will now commit the changes.
